# HackerNews
PROJECT OUTLINE
The tech news forum – Hacker News – is one of the most renowned source for the latest that’s
happening in the world of hi-tech. The forum provides a simple listing of articles, which are
submitted by users.

An article comprises of a URL, a title and an optional description.
Other forum members can up/down vote an article as they see fit. They can also comment on
an article to express their opinion about the topic covered in the article. Each comment can
in-turn be up/down voted and commented upon.
We would like you to create a simple app that provides an easy way to navigate the content on
the Hacker News forum, while providing certain features to enhance/improve the experience
of browsing hacker news and demonstrating your capabilities in handling use-cases.
The Hacker News forum can be accessed online here: https://news.ycombinator.com/

● Firebase notifications: for simple notification handling in the app.
● Realm.io for local storage and caching of data in the device.
